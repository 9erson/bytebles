		- No drinks or other sides
	- Choose pizza type
		- Pepperoni
		- Hawaiian
		- Vegetarian
	- Choose Pizza size
		- Small
		- Medium
		- Large
	- Ask for tip
	- display total
- practice python basics
	- Input - Prompt the user for choices
	- Variables - Store the user's choices to be used later
	- Type casting - Convert strings to integers to be able to calculate
	- Arithmetic Operations - Calculate cost based on pizza type and size
	- Print & f-Strings - Displaying formatted data. Totals should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

- Script Outline
	- Phase 1 
		- Outline
			- Welcome message
			- Assume Pizza total and Tip
			- Bill breakdown
			- Goodbye message
		- Code editor
			- Display welcome message
				- `print("Welcome to the Pizza Order Calculator!")`
			- Talk about print function
				- Built in function
				- Takes in a string
					- Surrounded by quotes
				- Displays the string to the screen
			- Set user input:
				- pizza_total
					- 13.46
				- Sub-total
					- = pizza_total
				- Tip Percentage
					- 15
			- Calculate totals
				- GST
					- `sub_total * 0.05`
				- Tip
					- `tip = sub_total * (tip_percentage / 100)`
					- We use parentheses to override the default order or operators
				- Total
					- `total = sub_total + gst + tip`
			- Display breakdown
				- Print breakdown title
					- Bill breakdown
				- Sub-total
					- We use f strings.
					- Don't need to convert floats or ints to string - required for string concatenation.
				- GST
					- We can round the totals with the f string.
					- This means - format this float accurate to 2 decimal places
				- Tip
					- We could also use the round function, but this is faster
				- Total
			- Display goodbye message
				- `print("\nThank you for using the Pizza Order Calculator!")`
			- Run code
				- I see
					- Welcome message
					- Breakdown totals
					- Goodbye message
	- Phase 2
		- Outline
			- Add ability for user to enter in tip
				- Prompt user for tip percentage
				- Cast to float
		- Code editor
			- After Welcome message
			- Create tip_percentage variable
			- Input
				- Enter tip percentage (example: 15 for 15%):
			- Input returns string
			- Need tip percentage in a future calculation - for total
			- We can only use integers or floats for calculations
			- Not strings
			- Cast or Convert to float
			- Run code
				- Prompted for a tip percentage
				- I'm going to say 20%
				- Enter
				- I can see the totals, including the tip I just entered in
	- Phase 3
		- Outline
			- Introduce Pizza Sizes
				- Set prices for cost of small, medium and large pizzas
				- Use of constants
					- Technically variables
					- All uppercase
					- Convention to hint to the programmer that value should not be updated
					- In some other languages, if something is set to a constant,
						- impossible to change
				- Prompt customer to choose a pizza size
				- Set sub-total based on choice
		- Code Editor
			- Set prices for 3 pizza sizes
				- small, medium and large
			- Create pizza size variable
				- `pizza_size = input("Enter size of pizza (small, medium, or large): ").lower()`
			- Prompt user for size
				- Input function
				- Lower function
					- unlike other functions, needs a dot.
					- goes on end of what it needs to affect
					- Converts input to lower case
					- Python distinguishes with case
						- small is not the same as SMALL
					- Ensures that a lowercase value is assigned to pizza_size variable
			- Calculate sub-title based on customer choice
				- We use if, elif, else statements
				- if pizza size is small, use the small price
					- Note the colon at the end of the if statement
					- Also note the following line is indented
					- You can use spaces, or a tab
					- Must be consistent
				- else if size is medium, use medium price
					- With Python, else if is shortened to elif
					- some languages don't shorten it
				- else use large price
					- if and elif need boolean expressions 
					- evaluate to True or False
					- can contain combinations of comparative operators (<, > etc), logical operators (and, or, etc).
			- Run code
				- I can now pick a size
					- Medium
				- Tip
					- 20
				- See breakdown & total
				- Run code again
				- Size
					- Large
				- Tip
					- 10
				- See breakdown
	- Phase 4
		- Outline
			- Introduce Pizza Types
				- Update prices for pizza size AND type
				- Prompt customer to choose a pizza type
				- Update if, elif, else logic to support Pizza Type
		- Code editor
			- Introduce 3 pizza types - pepperoni, hawaiian and vegetarian
			- Introduce variables for type and size
				- `PEPPERONI_SMALL = 10.0`
			- Separate them by __
			- In python, variable names can't have spaces
			- 9 unique 
			- Prompt user for type
			- Update calculations
			- Explain nested if statements
				- Before
					- If the user wanted a small pizza
						- Only one possibility
					- Now
						- 3 possibilities
							- Pepperoni
							- Hawaiian
							- Vegetarian
					- Another set of if, elif and else
						- One for each type
						- Within the if statement for small pizzas
						- Covers 
							- Small Pepperoni
							- Small Hawaiian
							- Small Vegetarian
				-
