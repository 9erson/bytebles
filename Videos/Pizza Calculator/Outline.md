- Script Outline
	- Phase 1 
		- Outline
			- Welcome message
			- Assume Pizza total and Tip
			- Bill breakdown
			- Goodbye message
		- Code editor
			- Display welcome message
				- `print("Welcome to the Pizza Order Calculator!")`
			- Talk about print function
				- Built in function
				- Takes in a string
					- Surrounded by quotes
				- Displays the string to the screen
			- Set user input:
				- pizza_total
					- 13.46
				- Sub-total
					- = pizza_total
				- Tip Percentage
					- 15
			- Calculate totals
				- GST
					- `sub_total * 0.05`
				- Tip
					- `tip = sub_total * (tip_percentage / 100)`
					- We use parentheses to override the default order or operators
				- Total
					- `total = sub_total + gst + tip`
			- Display breakdown
				- Print breakdown title
					- Bill breakdown
				- Sub-total
					- We use f strings.
					- Don't need to convert floats or ints to string - required for string concatenation.
				- GST
					- We can round the totals with the f string.
					- This means - format this float accurate to 2 decimal places
				- Tip
					- We could also use the round function, but this is faster
				- Total
			- Display goodbye message
				- `print("\nThank you for using the Pizza Order Calculator!")`
			- Run code
				- I see
					- Welcome message
					- Breakdown totals
					- Goodbye message
	- Phase 2
		- Add ability for user to enter in tip
		- Code editor
			- After Welcome message
			- Create tip_percentage variable
			- Input
				- Enter tip percentage (example: 15 for 15%):
			- Cast or Convert to float
			- In order to calculate the total later
