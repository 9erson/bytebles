- Simplified Python version
	- Pizza place
	- Simplify
		- Only one pizza
		- No drinks or other add-ons
	- Choose pizza type
		- Pepperoni
		- Hawaiian
		- Vegetarian
	- Choose Pizza size
		- Small
		- Medium
		- Large
	- Ask for tip
	- Display total
- Practice python basics
	- Input - Prompt the user for choices
	- Variables - Store the user's choices to be used later
	- Data casting - Convert strings to integers to be able to calculate
	- Arithmetic Operations - Calculate cost based on pizza type and size
	- Print & f-Strings - Displaying formatted data. Totals should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
- Demo of completed program
- Steps
	- Define pizza prices
		- Suggestions:
			-  PEPPERONI_SMALL = 10.0 
			- PEPPERONI_MEDIUM = 12.0 
			- PEPPERONI_LARGE = 15.0 
			- HAWAIIAN_SMALL = 11.0 
			- HAWAIIAN_MEDIUM = 13.0 
			- HAWAIIAN_LARGE = 16.0 
			- VEGETARIAN_SMALL = 9.0 
			- VEGETARIAN_MEDIUM = 11.0 
			- VEGETARIAN_LARGE = 14.0
		- Explain concepts:
			- Comments
			- Variables and Constants
			- Assignment operator
			- Floats & Integers
	- Prompt user for pizza type
		- Input
			- Get input from the user
			- Different results each time
		- Return value saved to variable
		- Returns a string
		- Need to change user input to lower case
	- Prompt user for pizza size
		- Same concepts as before
	- Calculate sub-total
		- If, elif, else
		- Nested if statements
		- Need for sub_total variable
	- Print out sub-total
	- Calculate GST
		- Assume 5%
		- Arithmetic operators
		- F-strings
		- Formatting floats to 2 decimal places
			- Round method
			- f-string format method
	- Prompt for tip
		- Cast string to float
		- Calculating tip
			- Parenthesis overrides default order of operations
	- Print total
