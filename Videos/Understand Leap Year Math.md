The first time you've probably heard of a leap year was when you learned that famous rhyme as a kid. There are many versions of it, here is my favourite...

> Thirty days has September,  
> April, June, and November,  
> All the rest have thirty-one,  
> Save February at twenty-eight,  
> But leap year, coming once in four,  
> February then has one day more.

According to this rhyme, a leap year is every four years. But is it?
