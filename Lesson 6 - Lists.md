## The List data type
- We have seen variables holding different types of data - strings, ints, floats and bools.
	- The one thing all these have in common is that the variable only holds one type of data at a time. 
	- You could change the variable to hold a different value and even a different value type, but it will still only be one at any given time.
- `List` is a new data type that allows you to store multiple values, each with its own data type in a single variable.
	- Example:
	  ```python
	  # Set person's name, age, height and if the person is married.
	  person1 = ["John", 25, 5.9, False]
	  person2 = ["Jane", 21, 5.0, True]
```
