Microsoft Teams is a great tool for online learning, especially for coding lessons. In this blog post, I will show you how to join my coding lesson in Teams using a link or a code that I will provide you. I will also show you how to use some of the key features of Teams during the lesson, such as raising your hand to ask a question, muting and unmuting yourself, turning your webcam on or off, sharing your screen, and requesting control of someone else’s screen. These instructions are compatible for both Windows and Mac users.

## How to Join My Coding Lesson Using a Link

If I have sent you an email invitation with a link to join the lesson, you can follow these steps:
-   Click on **Click here to join the meeting** in the email. This will take you to a web page where you can choose to either join on the web or download the app. If you already have the app installed, it will open automatically.
-   If you are joining on the web, you may need to sign in with your school account or create one if you don’t have one already.
-   Before joining the lesson, you can adjust your audio and video settings by clicking on **Device settings** (the gear icon) next to Join now button. You can then choose which microphone, speaker, camera, and resolution you want to use.
-   When you are ready, click on **Join now** to enter the lesson.

## How to Join My Coding Lesson Using a Code

If I have given you a code to join the lesson, you can follow these steps:
-   Download and install the Teams app or open the Teams webpage on a web browser. If the Teams app is already installed, simply open the Teams app icon.
-   On the left side of the screen, tap the **Teams** icon.
-   Select **Join or create a team** at the bottom of your teams list.
-   Paste in or type the code in the **Enter code** window.
-   Select **Join**.

## How to Raise Your Hand

If you want to ask a question or make a comment during a lesson without interrupting anyone else’s speech, you can use the raise hand feature. This will show an icon next to your name indicating that you have something to say.
-   To raise your hand during a lesson, click on **More actions** (the three dots) at the top of the lesson window and select **Raise hand**.
-   To lower your hand after speaking or changing your mind, click on **Lower hand** in the same menu.

## How to Mute and Unmute Yourself

Sometimes, it may be necessary to mute yourself during a lesson if there is background noise or if you don’t want others to hear what you are saying. You can also unmute yourself when you want to speak.
-   To mute yourself during a lesson, click on **Mute** (the microphone icon) at the bottom of the lesson window.
-   To unmute yourself, click on **Unmute** (the same icon) again.

## How to Turn Your Webcam On or Off

You may also want to turn your webcam on or off during a lesson depending on whether you want me and others to see your face or not. You can also change your video settings before joining a lesson.
-   To turn your webcam on or off during a lesson, click on **Camera** (the camera icon) at the bottom of the lesson window.
-   To change your video settings before joining a lesson, click on **Device settings** (the gear icon) next to Join now button when entering a lesson. You can then choose which camera and resolution you want to use.

## How to Share Your Screen

If you want to ask me question, or show me and others what’s on your screen during a lesson, you can use the screen sharing feature. This will allow you to share your entire desktop or a specific window or app.
-   To share your screen during a lesson, click on **Share** (the screen icon) at the bottom of the lesson window.
-   You will see a menu with different options for sharing your screen. You can choose to share your **Desktop**, which will show everything on your screen, or a specific **Window** or **App**, which will only show that particular item.
-   After choosing what you want to share, click on **Share** again to start sharing your screen.
-   To stop sharing your screen, click on **Stop sharing** at the top of the lesson window.
