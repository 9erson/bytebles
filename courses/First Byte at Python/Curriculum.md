Welcome to My Python Course!

I'm excited to have you join me on this journey of learning Python! Here are some important details and guidelines to help you get the most out of the course:

# Requirements

You'll need a desktop computer with either Windows or Mac operating system to participate in the course.I'll be using Thonny as the editor, which is free and available for all desktop platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux.

# Course Preparation

Before the course starts, please ensure you've prepared your environment by following the guides with videos that I've provided.I encourage you to complete this step before the first day of the course.

# Course Details

The course is divided into 8 lessons, each lasting an hour and a half.After each class, I'll stay back for questions.

## Lessons

-   [[Lesson 1 - The IPO Model]]
-   [[Lesson 2 - Data Types]]
-   [[Lesson 3 - Decisions]]
-   [[Lesson 4 - Loops]]
-   [[Lesson 5 - Functions]]
-   [[Lesson 6 - Modules]]
-   [[Lesson 7 - Dictionaries]]
-   [[Lesson 8 - Final Project]]

# Course Communication

- We'll use Microsoft Teams for our lessons.
- Every Monday, I'll email you with a link to the Teams session and a handout for the upcoming lesson as a PDF.
- I encourage you to read through and attempt the examples and exercises before the class.
- This will give you a chance to prepare questions that I can address during class.

# Classroom Guidelines

- Please do not chat during class, except when asking or answering questions.
- All of you will be on mute during class, except when asking questions or if asked a question.
- To ask a question, click the "Raise" button to get my attention.
- During demonstrations, please do not follow along. I want you to pay full attention to me.
- During practice sessions, you can work on examples, exercises, and projects.
- You can ask for help during practice sessions by sharing your screen.

I hope these guidelines help you prepare for the course. I'm looking forward to seeing you in class and helping you learn Python.
