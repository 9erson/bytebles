# Introduction

Loops are an essential tool in programming that allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly. Without loops, we would have to manually repeat the same code multiple times in order to achieve the same result. For example, in a user authentication system, we might have to check the user's credentials multiple times until they are authenticated. Without loops, this would require us to write the same code multiple times, which can be inefficient and error-prone.

Here's an example of what the code for user authentication might look like without using loops:

```python
username = "johndoe"
password = "password123"

authenticated = False

input_username = input("Enter your username: ")
input_password = input("Enter your password: ")
if input_username == username and input_password == password:
    authenticated = True
else:
    print("Access denied. Please try again.")

if not authenticated:
    input_username = input("Enter your username: ")
    input_password = input("Enter your password: ")
    if input_username == username and input_password == password:
        authenticated = True
    else:
        print("Access denied. Please try again.")

if not authenticated:
    input_username = input("Enter your username: ")
    input_password = input("Enter your password: ")
    if input_username == username and input_password == password:
        authenticated = True
    else:
        print("Access denied. Please try again.")
        
# continue repeating the same code until the user is authenticated
```

As you can see, the code becomes increasingly complex and repetitive as we add more checks for user authentication. This is where loops become a valuable tool, allowing us to automate the repetitive task of checking user credentials and reducing the likelihood of errors in the code.

# What are loops?

In programming, loops are used to repeat a set of instructions until a certain condition is met. Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks and can help you write more efficient and effective code.

# The while loop

The while loop is a type of loop that continues to execute a block of code as long as the specified condition is true. Here is the general syntax for a while loop:

```python
while condition:
    # code to execute while the condition is true
```

In the while loop, the condition is a boolean expression that is checked at the beginning of each iteration. If the condition is true, the code inside the loop is executed. If the condition is false, the loop exits and the program continues to the next statement.

# Example of a while loop

Here is an example of a while loop that counts from 1 to 10:

```python
count = 1
while count <= 10:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

In this example, the count variable is initialized to 1, and the while loop continues to execute as long as count is less than or equal to 10. Inside the loop, the current value of count is printed, and then count is incremented by 1. This process repeats until count is greater than 10, at which point the loop exits.

# Exercises

2. Print the reverse of a given number.
3. Generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.
4. Count the number of digits in a given number.
5. Find the largest and smallest digit in a given number.


# Conclusion

In this lesson, you have learned about loops in programming, the while loop, and an example of how to use a while loop in Python. You have also seen a use case where loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks. With this knowledge, you can begin to write more efficient and effective code.
