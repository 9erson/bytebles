In this lesson, you will learn about the basics of Python programming and the IPO model (Input, Processing, Output). You will explore the three components of the IPO model and their implementation in Python through displaying text and numbers, performing arithmetic operations, joining text, using variables, and obtaining user input at runtime. By the end of this lesson, you will have gained an understanding of how to create simple Python programs that incorporate input, processing, and output. You will also be tasked with creating a Madlibs generator program that asks the user for input and generates a humorous story based on the user's input.
