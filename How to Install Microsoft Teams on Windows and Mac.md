Microsoft Teams is a popular collaboration platform that allows you to chat, call, share files, and work together with your team members. Whether you are using it for work, school, or personal projects, you can easily install Microsoft Teams on your Windows or Mac computer by following these steps:

## Install Microsoft Teams Using the Official Installer

One of the easiest and widely used ways of installing Microsoft Teams is by downloading the setup directly from Microsoft's official website. This ensures you get the latest version of Teams without any malware.

- Open your web browser and go to [the official Microsoft Teams Download Page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app).
- Click on **Download for Desktop**.
- On the next page, click on **Download Teams** and wait for the download to be over.
- After the download is complete, run the downloaded file.
- Wait for Microsoft Teams to install.

## Install Microsoft Teams Using Windows Installer (MSI)

If you want to install Microsoft Teams for multiple users on a Windows computer, you can use the Windows Installer (MSI) package. This method allows you to deploy Teams across your organization without requiring each user to install it individually.

- Download [the MSI package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/msi-deployment) for 32-bit or 64-bit Windows depending on your system architecture.
- Run the MSI file as an administrator and follow the instructions.
- The MSI package will place an installer in `%SystemDrive%\Program Files\Teams Installer` on 32-bit Windows and `%SystemDrive%\Program Files (x86)\Teams Installer` on 64-bit Windows.
- Whenever a user signs into a new Windows user profile, the installer will launch and a copy of the Teams app will be installed in that user's `%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Teams` folder.

## Install Microsoft Teams Using Mac App Store

If you are using a Mac computer, you can also install Microsoft Teams from the Mac App Store. This way, you can get automatic updates and access to other features of the App Store.

- Open [the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-teams/id1113153706) and search for **Microsoft Teams**.
- Click on **Get** and then **Install**.
- Enter your Apple ID credentials if prompted.
- Wait for Microsoft Teams to install.
